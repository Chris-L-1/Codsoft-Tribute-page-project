                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Barnard">Christiaan Neethling Barnard </a>
                (1922â€“2001) was a South African cardiac surgeon who performed 
                the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4200566/">
                    first human-to-human heart transplant</a> on December 3, 1967. 
                Despite the patient, Louis Washkansky, dying 18 days later due to
                 pneumonia caused by anti-rejection drugs, Barnard's second patient lived for 18 months. 
                Born in Beaufort West, Barnard developed a life-saving technique 
                for intestinal atresia as a young doctor. After studying in the U.S., 
                he returned to South Africa and led the Department of Experimental 
                Surgery at Groote Schuur Hospital.
                He retired in 1983 due to rheumatoid arthritis 
                and later promoted an anti-aging cream that was
                discredited. He founded the Christiaan Barnard
                 Foundation to help underprivileged children and died in 2001 from an asthma attack.
